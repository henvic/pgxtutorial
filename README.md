This is an accompanying repository of the article [Back to basics: Writing an application using Go and PostgreSQL](https://henvic.dev/posts/go-postgres) by [Henrique Vicente](https://henvic.dev/). Feel free to open issues to ask any questions or comment on anything.

## Environment variables
pgxtutorial uses the following environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Description |
| - | - |
| PostgreSQL environment variables | Please check https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-envars.html |
| INTEGRATION_TESTDB | When running go test, database tests will only run if `INTEGRATION_TESTDB=true` |
| OTEL_EXPORTER | When OTEL_EXPORTER=stdout or OTEL_EXPORTER=otel, telemetry is exported |

## tl;dr
To play with it install [Go](https://go.dev/) on your system.
You'll need to connect to a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
You can check if a connection is working by calling `psql`.

To run tests:

```sh
# Run all tests passing INTEGRATION_TESTDB explicitly
$ INTEGRATION_TESTDB=true go test -v ./...
```

To run application:

```sh
# Create a database
$ psql -c "CREATE DATABASE pgxtutorial;"
# Set the environment variable PGDATABASE
$ export PGDATABASE=pgxtutorial
# Run migrations
$ tern migrate -m ./migrations
# Execute application
$ go run .

```

You could also
```
go install github.com/henvic/pgxtutorial@latest
```
to just get the `pgxtutorial` binary.
